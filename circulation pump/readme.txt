These are the latest designs for the circulation pump. Mine uses a clippard air cylinder from a junk bin and an electric gearmotor from ebay.
This pump pumps ~0.9cc/s, which is about right for my burner output. You want to aim for a circulation rate of around 5 times the evaporation rate.

Oh, and a 608 bearing and some metric bolts.

You can use something different, but you may have to edit the models. I got these off ebay.
