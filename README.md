# solenoid-valve-steam-engine
My latest steam engine using hall sensors and a solenoid valve.


This is for my solenoid valve steam engine using electronic controls. It uses an industrial air cylinder and valve. THERE IS NO MACHINING REQUIRED ANYWHERE! I see all these steam projects and you need a well equipped machine shop to produce anything big enough to do useful work, and I think that's dumb. So I set out to prove everyone wrong by building a complete steam powerplant that uses no machine tools beyond small hand tools (and a 3D printer), no welding (or brazing!), and no expensive specialty parts. Everything was bought from local hardware stores, ebay, aliexpress, amazon, etc. 

Even the boiler is easy to make, flare fittings, black pipe, and pop riveted sheet metal. I see too many "steam engines" that spend their whole lives running off an air compressor. This boiler is safe, compact, and powerful. It has no large heated pressure vessels to explode. In the event of a problem, the small copper tubing will rupture with a loud pop, some steam, and little danger. The boiler is an advanced design using a motor driven circulation pump that allows you to get maximum steam from minimum heated surface area, while still having simple controls. This advanced design actually makes it easier to build compared to more traditional designs.

My current powerplant has only one item that costs over ~$30, the burner. While this project will nickel and dime you to death, there are no big purchases that are hard to save up for. I know how hard it is to justify even a hundred dollars for a single item, and how easy it is to go broke five dollars at a time.

I want to thank china for making this possible and affordable. Their industrial air cylinder and valves actually work better with steam than the fancier brands. The cheap ones from china have little to no plastic parts, and seem to handle steam just fine. 

I previously tried to use a rotary encoder for valve timing, but I have now settled on using hall sensors and a magnet that moves with the cylinder. I added the rotary encoder code, and the cad files for the engine, but I do not recommend going this route.
